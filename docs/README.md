# pterrific-ui

A simply pterrific component library for React Native. Supports iOS, Android, and Web. Highly inspired by the design principles of [Chakra-UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/).

> NOTE: This library is HIGHLY work in progress. Breaking changes will be frequent and expected, so bear that in mind when using it.

## Examples

To interact with the full library of components and see if pterrific-ui is the right choice for your project, check out this snack on Expo. (coming soon!)

## Installation

You can install pterrific-ui with your favorite package manager.

```sh
$ yarn add pterrific-ui

# or

$ npm i pterrific-ui

```

## Usage

pterrific-ui contains a (small but growing) number of components, all built around the idea of sensible defaults with flexible styling. Using a component is as simple as importing it as a named import and using it in your React Native project:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'pterrific-ui';

// ...

<Button>Press Me!</Button>;
```
